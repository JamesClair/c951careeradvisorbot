## A. Explain the functionalities of the chatbot and how they will meet the needs described in the scenario.

The c951careeradvisorbot is an AIML chatbot designed to help computer science students identify and recommend a job type or career specialization based on a short survey.  The bot will interact with the student asking him/her questions that will help the student evaluate their strengths and preferences.  Once all questions have been answered the bot will evaluate the student's strengths and preferences and provide a personalized job type recommendation.

The following five initial career paths are supported:
1. Platform Engineer
2. Frontend Engineer
3. Backend Engineer
4. Network Engineer
5. Machine Learning Engineer

## C. Provide the generated chatbot code files to support the five identified job types from part B.

The files in this repository are published through pandorabot's native Github integration and represent all of the AIML files necessary to run the c951careeradvisorbot on the pandorabot platform. 

## D. Explain how the chatbot training cases were selected and how you used artificial intelligence markup language (AIML) to enhance the functionality of the chatbot. Provide examples of the chatbot’s functionality that represent the selected cases at the end of the training process in support of your explanation.


## E. Create an installation manual for the chatbot that includes the web link to access the live chatbot in the Pandorabot platform.


## F. Assess the strengths and weaknesses of the chatbot development environment and explain how they supported or impeded the construction of the chatbot.

## G. Explain how the chatbot will be monitored and maintained to improve the final user experience.
